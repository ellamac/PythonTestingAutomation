2. Then, commit and push your code to GitHub.
3. Make sure you can see the files in your web browser after Git push command (you might need to reload your page).

4. Then, create a GitHub Action that builds or lints and
5. optionally unit tests your source code. When creating the Action, you can use the
   ready-made workflow templates for Python, such as the one named "Python application".
